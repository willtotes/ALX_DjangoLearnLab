# Security Implementation Guide

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. HTTPS and Cookie Security
- `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True` - CSRF cookies only sent over HTTPS
- `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True` - Session cookies only sent over HTTPS
- `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True` - Automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirect

### 2. Security Headers
- `X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'DENY'` - Prevents clickjacking attacks
- `SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True` - Enables browser XSS protection
- `SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF = True` - Prevents MIME type sniffing

### 3. CSRF Protection
- All POST forms include `{% csrf_token %}` template tag
- Django's built-in CSRF middleware provides protection

### 4. SQL Injection Prevention
- Use Django ORM for all database queries
- Never use raw SQL with user input
- Parameterized queries for safe database access

### 5. XSS Prevention
- Input validation and sanitization in forms
- HTML content sanitization using regex patterns
- CSP headers to restrict content sources

### 6. Input Validation
- Server-side validation in forms and views
- Regular expression patterns for input sanitization
- Length and format validation for all user inputs

### 7. Secure Redirects
- Validation of redirect URLs to prevent open redirects
- Only allow redirects within the same domain

## Testing Security

### Manual Testing Checklist:
1. ✅ Test forms without CSRF token (should be rejected)
2. ✅ Test XSS payloads in input fields (should be sanitized)
3. ✅ Test SQL injection attempts (should be blocked by ORM)
4. ✅ Check HTTPS redirects in production
5. ✅ Verify security headers are present in responses

### Automated Testing:
Consider using:
- `django-security` package for additional security features
- OWASP ZAP for vulnerability scanning
- `bandit` for Python code security analysis
